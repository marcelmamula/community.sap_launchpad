:question: SAP Download authorizations for the SAP User ID

SAP software installation media must be obtained from SAP directly, and requires valid license agreements with SAP in order to access these files.

The error HTTP 401 refers to either:
- Unauthorized, the SAP User ID being used belongs to an SAP Company Number (SCN) with one or more Installation Number/s which do not have license agreements for these files
- Unauthorized, the SAP User ID being used does not have SAP Download authorizations
- Unauthorized, the SAP User ID is part of an SAP Universal ID and must use the password of the SAP Universal ID
  - In addition, if a SAP Universal ID is used then the recommendation is to check and reset the SAP User ID `Account Password` in the [SAP Universal ID Account Manager](https://account.sap.com/manage/accounts), which will help to avoid any potential conflicts.

This is documented under [Execution - Credentials](https://github.com/sap-linuxlab/community.sap_launchpad#requirements-dependencies-and-testing).

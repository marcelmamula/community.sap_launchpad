## Further Information

### Credentials - SAP S-User

SAP software files must be obtained from SAP directly, and requires valid license agreements with SAP in order to access these files.

An SAP Company Number (SCN) contains one or more Installation Number/s, providing licenses for specified SAP Software. When an SAP User ID is created within the SAP Customer Number (SCN), the administrator must provide SAP Download authorizations for the SAP User ID.

When an SAP User ID (e.g. S-User) is enabled with and part of an SAP Universal ID, then the `sap_launchpad` Ansible Collection **must** use:
- the SAP User ID
- the password for login with the SAP Universal ID

In addition, if a SAP Universal ID is used then the recommendation is to check and reset the SAP User ID ‘Account Password’ in the [SAP Universal ID Account Manager](https://account.sap.com/manage/accounts), which will help to avoid any potential conflicts.

For further information regarding connection errors, please see the FAQ section [Errors with prefix 'SAP SSO authentication failed - '](./docs/FAQ.md#errors-with-prefix-sap-sso-authentication-failed---).

**Multi Factor Authentication is not supported.**

### Variable Precedence Rules
Please follow [Ansible Precedence guidelines](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_variables.html#variable-precedence-where-should-i-put-a-variable) on how to pass variables when using this collection.
